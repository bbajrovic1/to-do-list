# to-do-list
Simple to do list app with html, css, js and node.js

This is an application that uses simple html and css, where the emphasis is on the use of javascript, node and express in order to exchange data between the frontend and backend side.
All of the created "to do" lists and their tasks are stored inside a JSON file.
The app uses get, post, put and delete requests on the backend side, and fetch functions on the frontend side to interact with the server and manipulate data.

These fetch functions enable the application to interact with the server, retrieve data, create new lists and tasks, update existing tasks, and delete tasks, providing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the project.
